Imbalanced_Data_nb
In this reposetory, I have placed my notebooks with works on imbalanced data. The aim of doing the work was to gain hand-on experience, building the intuition, and getting familiar with the most friquent approaches when working on imbalanced data.

Main approaches for dealing with imbalanced data:
1. On a data level
  - under-dampling
  - over-sampling
2. Cost sensative
3. Ensemble algorithms
In this reposetory, there are works with all 3 approaches.
